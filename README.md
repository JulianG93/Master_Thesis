# Welcome to my master's thesis!

For my master's thesis, "The effects of a crop price guarantee program in Thailand: Evidence from new data and method":

- I investigated the impact of agricultural subsidies on the livelihoods of Thai farmers,
- conducted an in-depth panel data analysis using a comprehensive dataset covering a 12-year period and ~4GB in size, and
- utilized the "Post-Double-Selection Lasso" machine learning algorithm for analysis (for explanation, check [here](https://statalasso.github.io/pdf/StataConference2018_AhrensSchaffer.pdf)).

➡️ The thesis resulted in 5000+ lines of Stata code which you can dive in [here](https://github.com/JulianG93/Master_Thesis/tree/main/Files). I received a grade of 1.3 (equiv. A-) and attached the [recommendation letter](Files/recommendation_letter.pdf) by my supervisors.
